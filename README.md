# Emxc

A Tesla REST client for the MEXC Exchange

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `emxc` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:emxc, ">= 0.0.5"}
  ]
end
```

## Warning
I would consider this pre-alpha software as though every endpoint has tests, the API and interface may change drastically as I refactor and clean things up.
Bear with me for a few days as I write a private test suite for use with real API keys to fully verify all of the private endpoints.

Made with ❤️ in partnership with Codeojo, Threephase Technology, TradeStudio, and MEXC Global.
